URL Parsing: The browser parses the URL to identify the protocol (http), the domain (somesite.com), and the path to the specific resource (/some/page.html).

DNS Lookup: The browser performs a DNS lookup to translate the domain name into an IP address that identifies the server on the internet.

TCP Connection: The browser initiates a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection with the server. This usually involves a three-way handshake to establish a reliable connection.

Send HTTP Request: The browser sends an HTTP GET request to the server, asking for the specified webpage3.
Server Response: The server processes the request, finds the page, and sends back an HTTP response, along with the requested HTML file.

Rendering the Page: The browser begins rendering the HTML on the page. It parses the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and makes additional HTTP requests for resources like images, scripts, and stylesheets.

Display Content: The browser displays the content to the user, allowing interaction with the webpage.
